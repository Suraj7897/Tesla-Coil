# Tesla-Coil

ABSTRACT
This project discusses the problems faced by the wired transmission of electricity and the possibility of
wireless energy transfer proposed by one of the greatest minds Nikola Tesla. It revolves around the
concept of electromagnetic induction and mutual induction.
The Tesla coil works with the principle of Electromagnetic Induction. According to which, when a
conductor is placed under a varying magnetic field, a small current will be induced inside the conductor.
For a Tesla coil this conductor will be called as the secondary coil and the varying magnetic field will
be produced by the primary coil by passing an oscillating current through the primary coil.
With this arrangement there is a primary coil which will have an oscillating current, and hence will
produce a carrying magnetic flux around it. Now, this coil is wound around the secondary coil and hence
according to the law of electromagnetic induction, a voltage will be induced in the secondary coil. Since
the number of turns in the secondary coil is very large than the primary coil, this voltage will be a very
high voltage and hence this coil will have a very strong electric flux around it that is powerful enough
to excite the fluorescent gases present in CFL bulbs and makes it glow. This is used in Wireless Power
Transmission.
Tesla coil accelerates any free electrons in the tube's low-pressure gas. These electrons pick up enough
energy before they collide with another gas atom that they ionize. The ionized electrons are then
accelerated and ionize further atoms. When electrons fall back onto the ionized atoms, visible light (as
in a neon filled tube) or UV light (from mercury vapor in a CFL) is emitted. The phosphor coating on
the inside of the fluorescent tube is excited by the UV photons or by the accelerated electrons directly.
This excitation of the phosphor coating produces a visible array of rays. Hence the CFL glows.

1. INTRODUCTION:
A Tesla coil is a radio frequency oscillator that makes the air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to
produce a high voltage with less current. It is an electric oscillator that produces signals in the frequency
range of about 20kHz to 100GHz.
This circuit was invented by the Swedish-American inventor Nikola Tesla in the year 1891. This was
the first system which could transmit electricity wirelessly. He used it in a number of his experiments
on electrical lightning, X-Ray generation, high frequency AC phenomena, wireless electrical energy
transmission and electrotherapy. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899–1900, by using
voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil, he was
able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about 100 feet (30 m)
This was a radical invention as it was later used on many devices like telephone and television systems.
The looser coils in the tesla coil could tolerate more voltage than the conventional iron cored
transformers could. This property made it have a wide range of application.

2. LITERATURE SURVEY:
[1] Wireless power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy from a power source to an electrical
load without any conductive physical connection. Wireless electricity ensure that the cell phones,
laptops, iPods, and other power electrical devices get changed on their own, with no need of plugging
them that can prevent the sockets with all sorts of wires. Wireless power transfer is when the magnetic
field is transferred over short distance. The magnetic field is created using inductive coupling between
coils of wire or electric fields using capacitive coupling between electrodes. The most common form of
wireless power transmission is carried out using direct induction followed by resonant magnetic
induction. The carrying fluxes that induce in the inductor can be captured by another inductive coil that
can produce an induced flux between the receiver coils that coupled to the primary coil. Since this
technique using magnetic field to transfer the electrical energy, the flux that produces in the primary coil
must be in high density with high frequency. Thus, the Tesla coil is used as a transmitter to produces
high voltage, high frequency and low alternating current in order to produce high density flux. In this
work, a Tesla coil is a main part of transmitter component in wireless electricity apparatus and need to
develop with a view to demonstrate how magnetic induction is coupled to perform a wireless power
transfer. In addition, the construction of winding coils of the Tesla coil would be the great effects in
order to provide electricity to supply a load without wires in distances. The advantages of the wireless
electricity system would be completely eliminating existing wires for electrical appliances between
power sources. With wireless electricity, the electrical system will be more secure as it will prevent user
from electrocution of current and the power failure due to short circuit and fault or power loss on cable
would never exist.
[2] The aim of this paper is to highlight the development of Tesla transformer throughout the decades
since its first patented design and to discuss the designing parameters required in construction and
manufacturing of Tesla transformers and to see the applications where different types for the same
transformers are used as per different specifications. The paper will also give information on health
hazards or how to take personal care while operating a Tesla coil. The paper shall as well try to provide
an understanding how the Tesla Coils can be used in various applications in brief. Also, the designing
of Tesla Transformers in comprehensive stepped flow chart for the clear understanding of readers has
been presented in successive sections of this journal article. The article being 'A Review ' paper does not
include detailed explanation about the designing of the Tesla Coils and hence a numerous parameter
which might be difficult to comprehend for common readers have been excluded and instead easy
methodology for explanation has been adopted for better understanding.
[3] Wireless power transfer is becoming ubiquitous in consumer electronics and electrified

transportation, providing a convenient method to supply power or charge various devices, such as cell
phones, watches, laptops, electric vehicles, and so on. Delivering power from one transmitter unit to
more than one receiver can save space and reduce the cost of the overall system. For applications where
the sizes of transmitter and receiver units are commeasurable, a frequently used design is the one with
carefully overlapped D-shaped coils (also named bipolar pad) to achieve decoupling between coils. In
this paper, an alternative optimized design of two concentric decoupled coils is proposed. The design
allows the receiver coils to operate at close proximity, collecting power from a shared magnetic field
generated by a single transmitter pad. The design methodology is based on a bucking coil layout where
the coils’ decoupling is achieved by means of flux cancellation caused by alternating the winding
direction of turns in one of the coils. Apart from eliminating coupling between the two receivers, the
proposed design maximizes the coupling between the transmitter and the second receiver coil and
consequently increases the power transfer capability, offering the equivalent coupling coefficient similar
to or better than a pair of bipolar DD coils. Finally, the number and space between turns are selected to
improve the quality factor of the proposed receiver. The proposed solution is designable analytically and
the second receiver can be added even after the first receiver is already built. Moreover, the proposed
design demonstrates superior misalignment tolerance, particularly in the lateral direction, compared to
other decoupled coil designs. The proposed methodology is validated through simulations and
experimental tests and has proved to be accurate and easy for implementation.
[4] This paper explores the current wireless power transmission schemes and their practicability. It also
delves into theory, design and construction of a method to transmit power through space. To this end,
the solid-state Tesla coil configuration is used as the basis to generate high voltage, high frequency
electrical power. Electrical power is crucial to modern systems. From the smallest of sensors and bionic
implants to satellites, remote controlled airplanes/cars/robots and oil platforms, it is important to be able
to deliver power by means other than wires or transmission lines. The use of wireless power
transmission, on a scale larger than used by magnetic induction devices, would allow for systems to
operate remotely without the need for relatively large energy storage devices or routine maintenance. It
will also be employed in cases where interconnecting wires is inconvenient, hazardous or impossible
such as in wet environments, rotating or moving joints as well as powering remote telecommunication
equipment.
3. OBJECTIVES:
The main objective of this project was to design and construct a working model of a tesla coil lamp. This
has been achieved and the results observed are also affixed in this project. The major objectives are to
understand the working concept of the Tesla coil and to create a working model of a Tesla coil.

4. PROJECT METHODOLOGY:
The tesla coil used in this project consists of two coils, namely primary and secondary coils. Both are
wound around the same non-conducting cylindrical object (PVC). But the secondary coil has a greater
number of turns and is smaller in diameter when compared to the primary coil. The primary coil is
connected to an oscillating power source. This produces a varying magnetic field around the primary
coil. Since there is a relative motion between the magnetic flux lines produced by the primary coil and
the secondary coil itself, an emf is induced in the secondary coil. Since the number of turns is very large
in the secondary coil (about 200-300), the voltage produced is also very high compared to the input
voltage supplied to the primary coil.
The oscillating electric field generated by a Tesla coil, excites the gas, commonly, mercury vapor, inside
the fluorescent light, which produces a UV light, which, in turn, excites the fluorescent material,
commonly, phosphor coating, which produces a visible light.
With a Tesla coil a very high AC voltage is applied to a circuit that includes the bulb and very small
capacitance between the coil, the bulb and other objects in the neighborhood. As a result, only a small
fraction of the coil voltage is applied to the bulb, but, considering that even a small Tesla coil can
generate voltages on the order of hundreds of kilovolts, its small fraction could be sufficient to ionize
the gas. This implies that the tesla coil can even light a burnt-out lightbulb still, so long as the bulb is
not cracked, meaning whatever gas it contains remains withing the bulb and since that is what reacts to
the tesla coils energy and causes light to emit from it.

5. WORKING:
The Tesla coil works on the principles of electromagnetic induction (Faraday’s laws) and resonance.
Electromagnetic Induction was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, and James Clerk. Maxwell
mathematically described it as Faraday’s law of induction.
A Tesla coil consists of two coils. A primary coil with 3-5 turns, and a secondary coil with about 200-
300 turns. A direct current is given through a 9V battery. This current then flows through the transistor.
The positive terminal of battery is connected to the collector of the transistor, through the primary coil.
The emitter is grounded. One end of the secondary coil is connected to the base of the transistor. This
way the current is oscillated as it enters the primary coil.
The oscillating current creates a varying magnetic field around the primary coil, according to Faraday’s
laws of electromagnetic induction. As the primary coil is coiled around the secondary coil, the varying
magnetic field causes an electromotive force in the secondary coil.
The voltage and the current produced in the secondary coil depend upon the number of turns in the
primary coil and the number of turns in the secondary coil. The following equation relates them;
𝑁𝑠
𝑁𝑝
=
𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑝
=
𝐼𝑝
𝐼𝑠
Where, Ns⇒ Number of turns in secondary coil
Np⇒ Number of turns in primary coil
Vs⇒ Voltage across secondary coil
Vp⇒ Voltage across primary coil
Is⇒ Current across secondary coil
Ip⇒ Current across primary coil
The EMF now generated in the secondary coil creates a high voltage electric field around it. This electric
field ionizes the mercury and argon vapors present inside the CFL bulb. The excited mercury vapors,
emit ultra-violet (UV) rays. These UV rays strike the surface of the glass tube which is coated with a
layer of phosphorous. The phosphorous layer in turn emits visible light.
Hence, even burnt-out bulbs can light up; given that the glass tube containing the gases has not cracked.
The uncracked-burnt out bulbs would still have the mercury vapors and hence they will also be able to
emit light if they are brought near the Tesla coil.

6. SYSTEM HARDWARE:
6.1 INSULATED COPPER WIRE:
These copper wires have a thin layer of insulation around them. Usually, they are
coated with a layer of enamel. They have a wide range of applications in the
electronics and automobile industries. They are used in the secondary coil in the
Tesla coil.
6.2 RESISTOR (2.2k OHM):
Resistor is a passive component used in every circuit to limit the amount of
current entering or leaving the components as required. A 2200 OHM resistor is
used in this circuit.

6.3 TRANSISTOR (2N2222):
The 2N2222 transistor is a NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor, which is used as a switching and amplifying
component in most of the circuits. But in this circuit, it is used to convert direct
current into oscillating current.
6.4 COMPACT FLUORESCENT LIGHT:
A CFL light bulb works differently from an incandescent or halogen
bulb. Incandescent and halogen bulbs work by passing an electric
current through a filament, which in turn heats up and produces light.
CFLs instead send electric current through a tube filled mostly with
argon gas, and a slight amount of mercury gas. These gases generate
ultraviolet light, which excites atoms on the phosphorous coating of
the tube, which in turn emits visible light.

6.5 PVC PIPE AS A NON-CONDUCTING TUBE:
PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride. It is a chlorinated hydrocarbon
polymer. In its natural state, it is rigid and brittle. But when combined with
additives such as plasticizers, it becomes more resilient and malleable.
Some of its applications are in electrical insulation, medical tubing,
flooring, furniture, signage and as a substitute for rubber. But its most
widespread use is in the manufacture of pipes, which are used in water
supply, plumbing and irrigation.
6.6 POWER SUPPLY:
Power can be supplied by the means of a battery or a regulated power
supply. Battery is a device which converts chemical energy into electrical
energy. A commercially available 9V battery has been used in this project.
A regulated power supply (RPS), gives a constant output, even if the input
current fluctuates.
7. BLOCK DIAGRAM:
The above figure shows the block diagram for a miniature tesla coil circuit.
DC Supply: The DC is supplied using a 9V battery in this project. Any other constant supply of DC can be
used.
2N2222 Transistor: This transistor converts the input DC into oscillating current. Oscillating current is
very much necessary for the production of a varying magnetic field around the primary coil.
Primary Coil: The primary coil uses the AC from the transistor and produces a varying magnetic field
around it.
Secondary Coil: An electromotive force is generated in the secondary coil due to the above mentioned
varying magnetic field. This EMF causes the ionization of the surrounding air.

8. CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:
The above circuit diagram is of a Slayer Exciter Circuit. This circuit is also called as a poor man’s tesla
coil. It consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil, a 9V battery, a 2N2222 transistor and a 2.2k ohm resistor.
The transistor is connected in a Common – Base Configuration. Both the input and output and the output
terminals of the primary coil are connected to the base terminal of NPN transistor. The positive terminal of
DC supply is connected to one end of the primary coil and to a 22k Ω resistor that is then connected the
base terminal of the 2N2222 transistor. The emitter terminal is then connected to the other end of the
primary coil, through the negative terminal of DC supply. One end of the secondary coil is connected to
the positive terminal of the DC supply and the other end is left free, from which the output can be recorded.
