# Tesla-Coil

**ABSTRACT**

This project discusses the problems faced by the wired transmission of electricity and the possibility of
wireless energy transfer proposed by one of the greatest minds Nikola Tesla. It revolves around the
concept of electromagnetic induction and mutual induction.
The Tesla coil works with the principle of Electromagnetic Induction. According to which, when a
conductor is placed under a varying magnetic field, a small current will be induced inside the conductor.
For a Tesla coil this conductor will be called as the secondary coil and the varying magnetic field will
be produced by the primary coil by passing an oscillating current through the primary coil.
With this arrangement there is a primary coil which will have an oscillating current, and hence will
produce a carrying magnetic flux around it. Now, this coil is wound around the secondary coil and hence
according to the law of electromagnetic induction, a voltage will be induced in the secondary coil. Since
the number of turns in the secondary coil is very large than the primary coil, this voltage will be a very
high voltage and hence this coil will have a very strong electric flux around it that is powerful enough
to excite the fluorescent gases present in CFL bulbs and makes it glow. This is used in Wireless Power
Transmission.
Tesla coil accelerates any free electrons in the tube's low-pressure gas. These electrons pick up enough
energy before they collide with another gas atom that they ionize. The ionized electrons are then
accelerated and ionize further atoms. When electrons fall back onto the ionized atoms, visible light (as
in a neon filled tube) or UV light (from mercury vapor in a CFL) is emitted. The phosphor coating on
the inside of the fluorescent tube is excited by the UV photons or by the accelerated electrons directly.
This excitation of the phosphor coating produces a visible array of rays. Hence the CFL glows.
