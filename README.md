# Tesla-Coil

**ABSTRACT**

This project discusses the problems faced by the wired transmission of electricity and the possibility of wireless energy transfer proposed by one of the greatest minds Nikola Tesla. It revolves around the
concept of electromagnetic induction and mutual induction. The Tesla coil works with the principle of Electromagnetic Induction. According to which, when a
conductor is placed under a varying magnetic field, a small current will be induced inside the conductor.
For a Tesla coil this conductor will be called as the secondary coil and the varying magnetic field will be produced by the primary coil by passing an oscillating current through the primary coil.
With this arrangement there is a primary coil which will have an oscillating current, and hence will produce a carrying magnetic flux around it. Now, this coil is wound around the secondary coil and hence
according to the law of electromagnetic induction, a voltage will be induced in the secondary coil. Since the number of turns in the secondary coil is very large than the primary coil, this voltage will be a very
high voltage and hence this coil will have a very strong electric flux around it that is powerful enough to excite the fluorescent gases present in CFL bulbs and makes it glow. 
This is used in Wireless Power Transmission.
Tesla coil accelerates any free electrons in the tube's low-pressure gas. These electrons pick up enough energy before they collide with another gas atom that they ionize. The ionized electrons are then
accelerated and ionize further atoms. When electrons fall back onto the ionized atoms, visible light (as in a neon filled tube) or UV light (from mercury vapor in a CFL) is emitted. The phosphor coating on
the inside of the fluorescent tube is excited by the UV photons or by the accelerated electrons directly.
This excitation of the phosphor coating produces a visible array of rays. Hence the CFL glows.

**INTRODUCTION:**

A Tesla coil is a radio frequency oscillator that makes the air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce a high voltage with less current. 
It is an electric oscillator that produces signals in the frequency range of about 20kHz to 100GHz.
This circuit was invented by the Swedish-American inventor Nikola Tesla in the year 1891. This was the first system which could transmit electricity wirelessly.
He used it in a number of his experiments on electrical lightning, X-Ray generation, high frequency AC phenomena, wireless electrical energy
transmission and electrotherapy. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899–1900, by using voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil, he was
able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about 100 feet (30 m). This was a radical invention as it was later used on many devices like telephone and television systems.
The looser coils in the tesla coil could tolerate more voltage than the conventional iron cored transformers could. This property made it have a wide range of application.

**OBJECTIVES:**

The main objective of this project was to design and construct a working model of a tesla coil lamp. This has been achieved and the results observed are also affixed in this project. 
The major objectives are to understand the working concept of the Tesla coil and to create a working model of a Tesla coil.

**DC Supply**: The DC is supplied using a 9V battery in this project. Any other constant supply of DC can be
used.
**2N2222 Transistor**: This transistor converts the input DC into oscillating current. Oscillating current is
very much necessary for the production of a varying magnetic field around the primary coil.
Primary Coil: The primary coil uses the AC from the transistor and produces a varying magnetic field
around it.
**Secondary Coil:** An electromotive force is generated in the secondary coil due to the above mentioned
varying magnetic field. This EMF causes the ionization of the surrounding air.

The above circuit diagram is of a Slayer Exciter Circuit. This circuit is also called as a poor man’s tesla coil.
It consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil, a 9V battery, a 2N2222 transistor and a 2.2k ohm resistor.
The transistor is connected in a Common – Base Configuration. Both the input and output and the output terminals of the 
primary coil are connected to the base terminal of NPN transistor. The positive terminal of DC supply is connected to one end of the 
primary coil and to a 22k Ω resistor that is then connected the base terminal of the 2N2222 transistor. The emitter terminal is then 
connected to the other end of the primary coil, through the negative terminal of DC supply. One end of the secondary coil is connected to
the positive terminal of the DC supply and the other end is left free, from which the output can be recorded.
